Open the Project in Your IDE:
Once the repository is cloned, open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.). Import the project as a Gradle or Maven project, depending on the build tool you used.

Build the Project:
Before running the application, you need to build it. In your IDE, look for the option to build the project. This will download dependencies and prepare the application for execution.

Run the Application:
In your IDE, find the main class (usually annotated with @SpringBootApplication) and run it as a Java application. This will start the embedded Tomcat server and deploy your application.

Once the application is running, open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8080/books to see the list of books. You can click on the "Details" link to view the details of a specific book.

Shutdown the Application:
To stop the application, you can simply stop it from your IDE by clicking the "Stop" button. This will shut down the embedded Tomcat server.
